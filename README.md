# Fake Users

This is a list of fake users, with random names, address, and profile
picture to use in your mockups and demos.

Check `./data/final.json` for the final list.

Data is done in a way that not two profiles can have the same profile picture.

## Example

Here is an example of a fake identity:

```json
{
  "email": "liam.walters@example.com",
  "gender": "male",
  "phone_number": "0438-376-652",
  "birthdate": 826530877,
  "location": {
    "street": "9156 dogwood ave",
    "city": "devonport",
    "state": "australian capital territory",
    "postcode": 7374
  },
  "username": "biglion964",
  "password": "training",
  "first_name": "liam",
  "last_name": "walters",
  "title": "mr",
  "picture": "men/50.jpg"
}
```
